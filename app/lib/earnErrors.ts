/**
 * User-facing copy for a failed Earn (LP vault) action.
 *
 * The generic `ERROR_CODE_MAP` copy is written for trading and is wrong or
 * silent here: the Earn panel used to show the raw `err.message`, so a vault
 * the market had locked read as an opaque "custom program error: 0x15".
 * Codes below are the deployed wrapper's (percolator-prog v18.2 `6377376a`)
 * `PercolatorError` ordinals as returned by DepositToLpVault (tag 75) and
 * ExecuteRedemption (tag 77):
 *
 *  21 EngineLockActive —
 *     deposit: the vault's backing pot is not in a state that can take new
 *       backing (`add_fresh_counterparty_backing_view`: the bucket is Fresh
 *       with a finite expiry — a realized-loss reservation the market opened
 *       — or lapsed / impaired), or the market is not Live. It clears when the
 *       keeper expires the lapsed bucket or the window ends; nothing the user
 *       can change fixes it.
 *     claim: paying the full redemption would leave the pot under-backed
 *       against traders' outstanding unrealized PnL (the stay-fully-backed
 *       `credit_rate_num == CREDIT_RATE_SCALE` gate), or the pot is not Fresh.
 *       It clears as those positions settle.
 *  19 EngineStale — the market's engine clock is behind (not cranked).
 *  36 LpVaultCooldownActive — the redemption cooldown has not elapsed.
 *  37 LpVaultOiReservationViolated — the payout would leave less than the
 *     vault's reservation threshold covering open interest.
 *  NotEnoughAccountKeys — the client sent a stale account list (a client bug,
 *     not the user's fault; see useInsuranceLP ExecuteRedemption).
