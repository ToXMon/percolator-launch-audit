/**
 * Exact per-user earnings for the Earn (wrapper LP vault) position card.
 *
 * The chain does not record what a depositor paid for their LP shares, so the
 * cost basis comes from the indexer (percolator-indexer#207): an average-cost
 * fold over the user's DepositToLpVault / ExecuteRedemption instructions.
 *
 *   value      = claimShares × vaultTotalAtoms / lpSupply     (same basis as Position Value)
 *   unrealized = value − cost_basis_atoms
 *   earned     = unrealized + realized_pnl_atoms              (realized = past redemptions)
 *
 * An exact figure is shown ONLY when it really is exact:
 *  - the indexer says `basisKnown` (no LP moved outside the vault, every event decoded), and
 *  - the indexer's share count equals what the wallet holds on-chain right now
 *    (held + escrowed in a pending redemption). A mismatch means the indexer is
 *    behind or the LP moved; either way the basis does not describe these shares.
 * Otherwise the card says the figure is unavailable rather than guessing. An
 * estimate "since par" was rejected in review (#2675): the vault's share price
 * includes fees earned before a late depositor joined, so it can show earnings
 * for a deposit that earned nothing.
